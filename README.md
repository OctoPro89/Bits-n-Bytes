# Bits-n-Bytes
A voxel game created with java.

Use run.bat to run the game otherwise library errors with appear

Controls: ESC to close, ctrl to fly fast shift to fly down, space to fly up, wasd to move, and e to unlock mouse.

Also I am on windows, so if you want to play on Linux or mac just change the bat file to your platform's command line script like .sh and then modify the command to use the directory of (example) "java -Djava.library.path=.\lwjgl-2.9.1\native\linux -jar VoxelGame.jar" or "java -Djava.library.path=.\lwjgl-2.9.1\native\macosx -jar VoxelGame.jar"
